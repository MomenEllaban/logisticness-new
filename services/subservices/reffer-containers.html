                    <h4> Specialised containers keep perishables fresh</h4>


                    <span>Ever wondered how fresh food and medicine get shipped around the world? Special refrigerated
                        containers, called reefer containers, are the answer. These high-tech boxes act like giant
                        refrigerators, maintaining a constant temperature, airflow,humidity, and drainage inside. This
                        controlled environment ensures delicate items like fruits, vegetables, and medications stay safe
                        and last longer.</span>

                    <h4> Perfect for food and medicine companies</h4>

                    <span>
                        Reefer containers are essential for businesses that deal with temperature-sensitive products. No
                        matter how hot or cold it gets outside, the reefer container keeps the inside at the perfect
                        temperature. This is crucial for maintaining the quality and safety of perishables.
