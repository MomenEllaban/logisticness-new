                    <span>Warehousing plays a critical role in the supply chain, acting as a temporary home for your
                        goods before they reach their final destination. It bridges the gap between shipping stages,
                        providing a secure and organized space to store your cargo.</span>

                    <h4> Protection and Organization: The final step before shipment</h4>

                    <span>
                        Warehousing ensures your products are safe and sound before they hit the road or sea. Warehouses
                        are designed to keep your cargo protected from external threats, with items meticulously
                        organized on pallets and bins for easy access and tracking.

                        Finding the perfect fit: Different warehousing options

                    <span>
                        The type of warehouse you choose depends on your specific needs. Here are two main options to
                        consider:
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>


                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Public Warehousing:</b> This is a cost-effective option where you rent a portion of a
                            shared warehouse space. This is ideal if you have a smaller volume of goods or fluctuating
                            storage requirements. The space allocation is typically based on your cargo's weight (CBM)
                            or weight.</li>
                        <li> <b>Private Warehousing:</b> This option provides you with exclusive use of an entire
                            warehouse. This is a good choice for businesses with high-volume inventory or specific
                            storage requirements, such as temperature control or specialized security measures. Private
                            warehouses are typically rented through contracts based on your specific needs and shipment
                            volume.</li>
